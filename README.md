# Repository structure
The repository contains a script file `vhive_stargz.sh`, which contains the necessary commands to perform experimentation with vHive running eStargz containers, and a folder which defines the kubernetes deployment files used by the automated experiment.
# Steps to run experiments
1. Clone the repository on a single node machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavidBuzatu-Marian/vHive-stargz-experiments
```
2. Run the `vhive_starg.sh` script with `sudo` rights:
```bash
sudo ./vhive_stargz.sh
```
